/**
 * An implementation of this interface encapsulates some of the SQL
 * session context's state variables, cf. SQL 2003, section 4.37.3,
 * notably those which we need to save and restore when entering a
 * stored procedure or function (which can contain SQL and thus a
 * nested connection), cf. 4.37.3, 4.27.3 and 4.34.1.1.  <p> Presently
 * this set contains the following properties: <ul> <li>current
 * role</li> <li>current schema</li> </ul>
 *
 * The standard specifies that the authorization stack be copied onto
 * the new SQL session context before it is pushed (and possibly
 * modifed) with a new cell for the authorization ids (user, role). In
 * our implementation we merge these two stacks for now. Also, the
 * authorization id of current user is not represented yet, since it
 * can not be modified in a session; Derby can not run routines with
 * definer's rights yet.
 * <p>
 * SQL session context is implemented as follows: Statements at root
 * connection level use the instance held by the the lcc, nested
 * connections maintain instances of SQLSessionContext, held by the
 * activation of the calling statement. This forms a logical stack as
 * required by the standard. The statement context also holds a
 * reference to the current SQLSessionContext.
 * <p>
 * When a dynamic result set references e.g. current role, the value
 * retrieved will always be that of the current role when the
 * statement is logically executed (inside procedure/function), not
 * the current value when the result set is accessed outside the
 * stored procedure/function.  This works since the nested SQL session
 * context is kept by the caller activation, so even though the
 * statement context of the call has been popped, we can get at the
 * final state of the nested SQL session context since the caller's
 * activation is alive as long as dynamic result sets need it).
 * <p>
 * If more than one nested connection is used inside a shared
 * procedure, they will share the same nested SQL session
 * context. Since the same dynamic call context is involved, this
 * seems correct.
